### 🎨 Beautiful Desktop Themes
Move beyond the default white background. Choose from carefully crafted, high-contrast dark themes:
- **Dracula**: The classic, dark and vibrant color palette.
- **Monokai Pro**: A sleek, professional dark grey look.
- **Nord**: Cool, arctic-inspired tones for reduced eye strain.

### ⚡ Productivity Superpowers
- **Snippet Manager**: Save your frequently used functions and boilerplate code. Inject them instantly with a few clicks.
- **Command Palette**: Access all features via a quick-search interface.
- **Rainbow Brackets**: Never get lost in nested parentheses again.
- **TODO Highlight**: Map out your work with styled `TODO` and `FIXME` markers in your comments.

### 🧘 Zen Mode
Enter a distraction-free state. Hide the clutter of the Google UI and focus purely on your code. Toggle with `F11`.

### 💎 Polished Dashboard UI
We don't just theme the editor; we theme the entire workspace:
- **Triggers & Executions**: Tables are reimagined with a premium, IDE-like aesthetic.
- **Thematic Menus**: Popups, selectors, and dropdowns follow your chosen theme.
- **Searchable Autocomplete**: Integrated look for the filter and search tools.
